It does not have to be washed, peeled or stressed-over to be used-up quickly. There are many different frozen fruit mixtures at the grocery store that can liven up any meal or snack. Here are a few ideas:\r\n\r\n    Yummy Baked Goods – Frozen fruit can easily be substituted for fresh fruit in most quick bread recipes, such as muffins. Blueberries are popular but don’t forget about raspberries, cherries or mixed berries.\r\n    Simple Dessert – An easy dessert or addition to a meal can simply be frozen fruit that is slightly thawed. For a special treat, top with a spoonful of frozen yogurt or ice cream.\r\n    Smoothies – Place in a blender any type of frozen fruit such as strawberries or mango; add yogurt, milk or juice and blend until smooth.\r\n    Fruit Slush – Cut slightly thawed frozen fruit into bite-sized pieces, add fruit juice and/or canned fruit such as crushed pineapple and freeze in small cups or bowls. Serve slightly thawed.\r\n    Topping for Pancakes and Waffles – Make a delicious topping by heating frozen fruit in a saucepan on the stove. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for approximately 15 minutes until sauce thickens slightly. Or try a quicker method of microwaving fruit until warm.\r\n    Yogurt Parfaits – Thaw fruit and layer it with yogurt, granola or other dry cereal. Sprinkle with a topping of nuts or sunflower seeds for added protein.\r\n    Gelatin – Add in your favorite frozen fruit with any flavor of gelatin to make it more nutritious. Mix well-drained, thawed fruit into the gelatin when it starts to set.\r\n    Freezer Pops – Why not make freezer pops a little more nutrient-packed with frozen fruit? Blend slightly thawed fruit with fruit juice. Freeze in ice pop molds or use small plastic or paper cups. Cover each cup with plastic wrap and insert a wooden pop stick.\r\n    Cereal Topper – Throw a few slightly thawed blueberries, raspberries or cherries on your bowl of cereal in the morning. Fruit adds zing to any dry cereal.\r\n    Oatmeal – Oatmeal is delicious with the addition of frozen fruit. Not only think of berries but also cherries, mango and even peaches. Below is a basic recipe but, feel free to experiment with your favorite fruits and flavors!\r\n','https://food.unl.edu/newsletters/images/frozen-berries.jpg',12),(37,'Are Strawberries a Fruit, a Vegetable, or Something Else?','Did you know that strawberries are the most widely-grown fruit crop? That’s right – strawberries are considered a fruit and not a vegetable, which is something you probably already knew. There’s more to it than that, though! In this article, we’ll explain what type of fruit strawberries are considered (according to botanists) and all the reasons why!\r\nThree strawberries with the words \"Fruit?\" \"Vegetable?\" and \"Something Else\" above them.\r\nWhat makes strawberries a fruit?\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to fruits and vegetables, you might be quick to think “if it tastes sweet, it must be a fruit” – and nobody would blame you, since that’s the case in many instances. However, there are sneaky exceptions – just look at the non-sweet tomato and avocado, which are both botanically considered fruits.\r\nMY LATEST VIDEOS\r\n\r\nSo what technically makes something a fruit if it has nothing to do with sweetness? You’ll find plenty of definitions out there, but here’s a description that really helps explain it: if it grew from a seed and the seed is still present in the mature structure, it’s likely a fruit! In addition, fruit grows from flowers on the tree or plant.\r\n\r\nJust look at common types of fruit like apples, raspberries, and bananas – all of them contain seeds as mature fruit. And before you ask, yes, bananas do have seeds! They’re the tiny black flecks in the center of the banana – they’re just much smaller and less obvious than apple and raspberry seeds.\r\nWhat sets vegetables apart from fruit?\r\n\r\nVegetables are considered the edible portion of a plant, such as a stem, leaves, root, tuber, bulb, and flowering head. Vegetables also don’t contain seeds – at least not if they’re a vegetable in a botanical sense (more on that next). \r\n\r\nHere are some examples of true vegetables as classified in a botanical sense:\r\n\r\nStem: celery, asparagus\r\n\r\nLeaves: lettuce, spinach\r\n\r\nRoot: garlic, carrots, potatoes\r\n\r\nTuber (a type of underground stem): potatoes, parsnips, beets\r\n\r\nBulb: onion, garlic, leeks\r\n\r\nFlowering head (also called cruciferous veggies): broccoli, cauliflower\r\n\r\n(As you can see, many root vegetables can also be considered tubers or bulbs!)','https://thecoconutmama.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/strawberry-fruit-vegetable-something-else-Shutterstock_1919334386-1-scaled.webp',12),(38,'A BEAUTIFUL MIXED FRUIT SALAD','There really is nothing like a fresh fruit salad.
